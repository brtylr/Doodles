ALL NOTES FOR .bat CREATION


Scan barcode > read ID OR type manually
	scan a sample of each barcode, barcode simply needs to match pdf name

Find ID.pdf in folder
	if ID.pdf is appended with _1 or _X, this complicates thing
	can write loop conditional: “if ID.pdf, then search ID_1.pdf

Open .pdf

Pause, wait for any key

Copy move ID.pdf > 3 folders
—Notes
/Y suppresses overwrite request popup

The current version of this batch file requires an unappended pdf file. If there are multiple copies that have _1, _2, and so on, this file will only copy the first file that lacks any appendix.

Start adobe/open pdf might require all pdfs be closed. Pdf may or may not open with program already open.
